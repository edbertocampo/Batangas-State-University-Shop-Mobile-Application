<br>

## Project Description

Batangas State University, as a university that focuses on providing academic excellence, the need for better equipment and supplies is emerging, specifically the demands of each student on the campus. Additionally, because most of us are unable to freely get the aforementioned goods or equipment due to the pandemic's repression of the population, we will have to physically carry out going to the shop, therefore a system that would facilitate doing so would be quite helpful.

The following can assist you in resolving problems like the need to check out and be aware of the location before seeing and purchasing the product. In response, the students are permitted to check the official news and announcement for the availability and purchase the goods online because there is no guarantee that the items they desire are accessible. They will be informed whether the items they bought are available.

## Development Model

The application development lifecycle consists of a multistep procedure to successfully establish the application. This involves understanding the step-by-step and repetitive processes that exist within the system. The methodology was divided into several parts to be passed through sequentially. Starting with the planning phase, what will be the design, development process, testing, deployment, review, and lastly, to launch.

#### Initiation and Requirement Analysis

Within the initiation phase, the team seeks to produce a mobile application that intends to give updates with regards to the supplies within Batangas State University. The main purpose was to initiate an application, allowing the administrators to set real-time updates considering the number of school supplies to inform the users about their availability.

#### Designing the Application

Designing the application exhibits initial paperwork consisting of all the necessities for the application. Including the existence of a wireframe that will serve as a blueprint to further illustrate the structure and a high-fidelity render design showing the overall appearance of the application.

#### Development

During the development phase, the team will work with the coding procedure to develop the application that will satisfy the objectives and will effectively act its purpose for the users.

#### App Testing and Debugging

For this phase, the team will have a multistep process to examine the codes for possible bugs and errors and make adjustments if failures are present. Through the testing and debugging process, the application will have its reliability and development to be able to meet the objectives and user satisfaction.

#### Launch

After successfully passing the testing and debugging process, the application will be launched and become accessible to the users, and will be informative regarding school supply updates.

#### Review/Monitoring

The team will take into consideration on reviews and possible issues to arise upon running the application. Aiming to continually improve, support, and remain reliable for the applicationâ€™s success.



## System Architecture

To show how users interact with the program, the team presents the aforementioned diagrams. It depicts that a user can browse the university shop, make purchases and reserve items.
